# Investment-calculator

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
-For this project I was tasked to show how an investment can grow overtime.
The program asks for the user's initial investment, monthly deposit, annual interst,
and the number of years they wish to see how their investment grows. it then calculates
and shoes the users their balance after interest and how much interest was accumilated 
each year until the amount of years specified.

What did you do particularly well?
I think what i did really was was i was able to make the main only 3 statements, keeping it nice and short.
i was able to do this by fitting most of the code into the class which included many different functions

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think one major thing that I was a bit unhappy with was the spacing between the print statements. I made the 
user interface as well as i could but you can easily run into some cosmetic problems
for example, when the program prints the years and their balances, if a number appends a digit to any of the three headers
(Year, year end balance, year end earned interest) than the rest of the numbers become unaligned


Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I think the main thing that i struggled with the most with this project wasnt neccesarly the codeing, but instead it was the structure
of building a class and I also stuggled with connecting the files together. I ran into an issue where i had the files placed wrong and i was unable to
connect them together. I spend the longest time trying to figure out why my code wasnt working and why the files werent connecting, and once i figured
it out, I spend a little more time trying to fix the file locations.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
A major skill that I thought was the most important when creating this project was being able to create a class and the structures that come with doing so
It was also helpful with knowing how to seperate your code such as having a header seperate from your function code in
in order to make things more easy to read for someone not involved with the creation of the code.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Again, i was able to successful seperate all the code into different files with a Main.cpp, investment.cpp and an investment.h
I was also able to make the main file a short as possible.
